# Guardian-Angel

## Background

There are people in this world that have become disconnected with their community,
livelihood and struggle to reconnect. Our goal is to create an application that
allows users to leverage technology to help these people. By creating a `Need` a
person will be able to connect those that need help with those that want to help.

This application will allow people to network with others to help someone in need.
By generating a need, a user will become a "Guardian" and be able to take in applicant
"Angels". Alongside, a Guardian may also be an Angel themselves and decide to help
someone in need.

The focus of the app will rely heavily on a users own vetting process to decide if
they will want to accept the help, and we will provide location based tools to help.
We feel that by creating an easy user experience to organically explore how to help or get someone some help, the world can be a little better than when we started.

## Functionality & MVPS
With this app users will be able to:
1. View an index of NEEDS
2. View a map of a zip code and see NEEDS in that area.
3. See a Dashboard of their currently created NEEDS
4. View a list of messages started with potential ANGELS
5. Carry on a direct message with another User.
6. (BONUS) Endorse other users
7. (BONUS) Follow other users.
8. (BONUS) Utilize D3 for user and zone statistics
